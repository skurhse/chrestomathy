# Fibonacci Sequence

In mathematics, the "Fibonacci sequence" is a numeric sequence in which each element is the sum of the two preceding.

The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1, or from 1 and 2, as did Fibonacci. 

The Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics as early as 200 BC in work by poet and mathmetician [Acharya Pingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala) on enumerating patterns of Sanskrit poetry, in a sequence called *mātrāmeru*.

Pingala was a scholar in the Maurya Empire, a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power in South Asia. Pingala is sometimes accredited with the first use of the number zero, as he used the Sanskrit word *śūnya* to explicitly refer to the number.

The Fibonacci numbers are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci).

Leonardo introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics in his 1202 book [Liber Abaci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_Abaci).
