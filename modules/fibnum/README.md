In mathematics, the "Fibonacci sequence" is a numeric sequence in which each element is the sum of the two preceding.

The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1, or from 1 and 2, as did Fibonacci. 

The Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics as early as 200 BC in work by Sanskrit poet and mathmetician [Acharya Pingala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingala) on enumerating possible patterns of poetry.

The Fibonacci numbers are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci)/.

Leonardo introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics in his 1202 book [Liber Abaci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_Abaci).
